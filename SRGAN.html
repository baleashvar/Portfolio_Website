          <h4>1 Introduction</h4>
          <div>
          Cosmic bodies Image Improvization using Super Resolution was my Final year Project.
          This Deeplearning model can be used to improve resolution of far away celestial body images 
          that have been captured by Telescopes and have blurred low resolution image. 
          Super Resolution is the process of fusion for reconstructing a high resolution
          image from several low resolution images. It extends classical single frame image
          reconstruction/restoration methods by simultaneously using information from
          multiple observed images to achieve resolutions higher than that of the original
          data. These observations can be low resolution images captured simultaneously or
          at different times by a single or multiple imaging devices. This methodology, also
          known as multi frame super-resolution reconstruction, registers the observed
          images to a common high resolution reference frame in order to formulate the
          problem of fusion as one of constrained image reconstruction with missing data.<br><br></div>

          <h5>There are three major steps involved in Super resolution namely:</h5>
            <div><ul>
          <li>LR image acquisition: Acquisition of a sequence of low resolution images
          from the same scene with non-integer (in terms of inter-pixel distances)
          geometric displacements between any two of the images.<br></li>
          <li>Image registration/motion compensation: Estimation of the sub-pixel
          geometric transformation of each source image with respect to the reference
          HR desirable grid.<br></li>
          <li>HR image reconstruction: Solution of the problem of reconstructing a high
          resolution image from the available data supplied by the source images.</li><br>

          The theoretical basis for super-resolution was laid by Papoulis , with
          the Generalised Sampling Theorem. It was shown that a continuous band-limited
          signal z(x) may be reconstructed from samples of convolutions of z(x) with
          different filters, assuming these filters satisfy certain conditions.<br><br></ul></div>

          <h4>2 Low Resolution Image</h4>
          To define in simple terms, image resolution is a measure of the detail that an image
          contains. In digital imaging, the resolution of an image commonly refers to the
          number of pixels present on a unit area of the screen. It is described and measured
          in PPI or pixels per inch, an indication of the number of pixels occupying per inch
          of the screen.<br><br>
          Figure 1
          <img src="assets/img/inner-page/srgan1.png" alt="" align="align-items-center">
          <br>
          This figure is an extremely low-resolution image (12 × 12), enlarged to show the
          individual pixels. Also, to keep things simple, consider it to be a black-and-white
          image, so that we only need a single bit of information to determine a pixel&#39;s color.
          
          In this case, 0 will be a black pixel, 1 will be white. Thus, a numerical
          representation of this image would be as follows:<br><br>

          <h4>3 SRGAN<br></h4><ul>
          <h5><li> Image Super Resolution:<br></h5></li>
          Image super resolution can be defined as increasing the size of small images while
          keeping the drop in quality to minimum, or restoring high resolution images from
          rich details obtained from low resolution images. This problem is quite complex
          since there exist multiple solutions for a given low resolution image. This has
          numerous applications like satellite and aerial image analysis, medical image
          processing, compressed image/video enhancement etc.<br><br></ul>

          <h4>4 Problem Statement:<br></h4>
          To recover or restore high resolution image from low resolution image. There are
          many forms of image enhancement which includes noise-reduction, up-scaling
          image and color adjustments. This post will discuss enhancing low resolution
          images by applying deep network with adversarial network (Generative Adversarial
          Networks) to produce high resolutions images.
          Our main target is to reconstruct super resolution image or high resolution image by
          up-scaling low resolution image such that texture detail in the reconstructed SR
          images is not lost.<br><br>

        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>5 What factors causes low resolution images?</h4><br>
          
          Image quality can deeply affect the entire subjective appearance of a photo.
          Therefore, it is necessary to improve your picture quality for it to be impactful.
          There are various potential reasons which may cause low-resolution images. A few
          of them are listed below.<br><ul><br>
          <li> Image Enlargement<br></li>
          A common cause for images to be of low quality is when it is enlarged without
          proper tools. Increasing the size of the image can often result in the photo losing its
          quality and resolution to drop significantly. It is therefore advised to resize your
          image with the aid of an appropriate tool to not compromise on the quality of the
          picture.<br><br>

          <li> Unstable Camera Shots<br></li>
          Shaky camera work is all that is needed for low-resolution photos. If the device is
          unsteady, the images that come out are bound to be blurry, out of focus, and
          pixelated. All of these can drastically reduce the overall quality or resolution of an
          image.<br><br>

          <li> Blurry Images<br></li>
          In instances when the subject is not properly focused, images can come out to
          be imminently blurry and low in quality. Unfocused and indistinctive photos come
          off as a great turn-off to the viewer&#39;s eye.<br><br>


          <li> Poor Camera Settings<br></li>
          Lack of proper and advisable camera settings can greatly affect the quality of an
          image produced. Details such as ISO, aperture, and exposure can play a key role in
          making or breaking your image resolution.<br><br>

          <li> File Damage<br></li>
          Severe damage or corruption to the file can also result in the image appearing to be
          pixelated or grainy. In often cases, file formats that are corrupted or otherwise highly
          damaged seem to be significantly low in resolution.<br><br>

          </p></ul>
          <p>
            <h4>6 Why Deep Learning?<br></h4><ul>
              There are various ways of enhancing image quality. One of the most commonly
              used technique is interpolation. This is easy to use but this leads to distorted image
              or reduces the visual quality of image. Most common interpolation methods
              produce blurry images, i.e. bi-cubic interpolation. More sophisticated methods
              exploit internal similarities of a given image or, use data-sets of lowresolution
              images and their highresolution counterparts to effectively learn a mapping between
              them. Among ExampleBased SR algorithms, the SparseCodingBased method is one
              of the most popular.<br>
              Deep learning provides better solution to get optimized images. In recent years
              many methods have been proposed for Image Super Resolution. Here we will be
              discussing about SRGAN. Lets see other methods in deep learning:<br><br>
              <li> SRCNN : SRCNN was the first deep learning method to outperform traditional
              ones. It is a Convolutional Neural Network consisting of only 3 convolution
              layers: patch extraction and representation, nonlinear mapping and
              reconstruction.<br></li>
              <li> VDSR : Very Deep Super Resolution employs the similar structure as SRCNN,
              but goes deeper to achieve higher accuracy. Both SRCNN and VDSR apply bi-
              cubic up-sampling at the input stage and deal with the feature maps at the same
              scale as output.</li></ul><br>

          <p>
            <h4>7 About SRGAN-Super resolution Generative Adverserial Networks<br></h4><br>
            GANs : GANs are class of AI algorithms used in Unsupervised Machine Learning.
            GANs are deep neural network architectures comprised of two networks (Generator
            and Discriminator) pitting one against the other (thus the “adversarial”). GANs is
            about creating, like drawing a portrait or composing a symphony. The main focus
            for GANs is to generate data from scratch.<br>
            To understand GANs, first we need to understand what a generative model is. In
            machine learning, the two main classes of models are generative and discriminative.
            A discriminative model is one that discriminates between two (or more) different
            classes of data — for example a convolutional neural network that is trained to
            output 1 given an image of a car and 0 otherwise. A generative model on the other
            hand doesn’t know anything about classes of data. Instead, its purpose is to generate
            new data which fits the distribution of the training data.<br>
            GANs consist of a Generator and Discriminator. Think it like a game where
            Generator tries to produce some data from probability distribution and
            Discriminator acts like a judge. Discriminator decides whether input is coming from
            true training data set of fake generated data. Generator tries to optimize data so that
            it can match true training data. Or we can say discriminator is guiding generator to
            produce realistic data. They just work like encoder and decoder.<br>
            Let make it easy by taking an example-Lets say we want to generate animated
            characters face. So we will provide training data which consists of images of anime
            character faces. And fake data consists of some random noise. Now Generator will
            try to produce image from noise which will be judged by discriminator. Both will
            keep training so that generator can generate images which can match true training
            data. One interesting thing is, images generated by generator will have features
            from original training data images but may or may not be the same. So like this we
            can generate some anime faces with heterogeneous mix of features from training
            data.<br>.<br>
            Figure 3
            <img src="assets/img/inner-page/srgan3.png" alt=""><br>.<br>
            Discriminator and Generator are both learning at the same time, and once Generator
            is trained it knows enough about the distribution of the training samples so that it
            can now generate new samples which share very similar properties.
            Idea Behind SRGAN : We have seen various ways for Single image super
            resolution. Those ways are fast and accurate as well. But still there is one problem
            which is not solved. That is, how can we recover finer texture details from low
            resolution image so that image is not distorted. Recent work has largely focused on
            minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. The results have high peak
            signal-to-noise ratios(PSNR) means we have good image quality results, but they
            are often lacking high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying as they
            are not able to match the fidelity expected in high resolution images. Previous ways
            try to see similarity in pixel space which led to perceptually unsatisfying results or
            they produce blurry images. So we need a stable model which can capture the
            perceptual differences between the model’s output and the ground truth image.To
            achieve this we will use Perceptual loss function which comprise of Content and
            Adversarial loss. Other then that SRGAN uses residual blocks for deep neural
            network.<br><br>

              <h4>9 Preparing the Dataset</h4>
              Obtaining Dataset for training the proposed model was a pretty easy job since the
              images were randomly downloaded various random images from random portals.
              number of images in my dataset is 100 images which will be resized into two
              various resolutions namely high resolution 384x384 images and low resolution
              92x92 images. And training is done on 300 epochs. The Proposed model is capable
              of improving resolution of any images since its trained using random images.<br><br>

            
              <h4>10 Proposed System</h4>
              The GAN that I used contains residual networks(ResNet) instead of deep
              convolution networks because training is made easier since residual networks used
              a type of connection called skip connections. People at Microsoft were able to
              come up with a type of neural network called residual network. Residual network

              or ResNet uses a type of connection called skip connection. Whenever a layer
              affects the performance of the architecture that particular lyer will be skipped but
              this does not affect the overall performance of the architecture but reduces
              resources and training time.<br><br>
           
              <h4>11 Advantages:</h4><ul>
              <li> It is also used to overcome Vanishing/Exploding gradient found in CNN.</li>
              <li> It uses less resources</li>
              <li> It also takes less time to train without affecting Performance of the NN</li>
              </ul>
              <br><br>
              <h4>Output</h4>

          <p></p>
          <br>
          <h4>Conclusion</h4>

            We are able to obtain Super resolution images from trained generator and
            discriminator networks since we have used 100 images and trained using 300
            iterations(epochs) we are able to obtain super resolution image that looks better
            than the low resolution image. Hence we can use this neural network model to
            obtain super resolution images of macroscopic applications like cosmic bodies for
            example sun, stars, galaxies etc.<br><br><br>
